The app try to check if sync is available and, if not you get and error screen like this:

At this point you can choice if you what to:
* loose your local changes and reopen from remote
* export your data to manually (and externaly) sync or overwrite remote file

### Merge Database ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/new_in-5.4-gree)

Starting with version 5.4, an experimental feature called "Merge Database" is available in the app under APP --> Sync.

When this setting is active, if both your local and remote files have been modified, the app will attempt to identify conflicts. A progress window will be displayed during this potentially lengthy process. Once conflicts are identified, you'll be prompted to choose which version of the file you'd like to keep.
